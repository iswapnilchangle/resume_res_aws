Write a node js 20 code for a website

Edit

Sources: medium.com (1) www3.ntu.edu.sg (2) nodejs.org (3) devforum.roblox.com (4)

Sure, here's an example of a simple Node.js web server using Express for a website:

First, you need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js application by running the following commands in your terminal:

bash
Edit
Run
Full Screen
Copy code
mkdir my-website
cd my-website
npm init -y
This will create a new package.json file in your project directory.

Next, you need to install Express, a popular web framework for Node.js. You can install it by running the following command:

bash
Edit
Run
Full Screen
Copy code
npm install express
Now, you can create a new file called app.js in your project directory and add the following code:

javascript
Edit
Run
Full Screen
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`);
});
This code creates a new Express application and sets up a route for the root URL (/) that responds with the text "Hello, world!". It also starts the server listening on port 3000.

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Edit
Run
Full Screen
Copy code
node app.js
You should see the message "Example app listening on port 3000!" in your terminal. You can now open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your website in action.

Note: This is a very basic example of a Node.js web server using Express. In a real-world application, you would likely have multiple routes, use templates to render HTML, and handle errors and exceptions.

Write a node js code for a responsive website for a CV or resume

});

To make your website responsive, you can use CSS media queries to adjust the layout based on the screen size. Here's an example of how you can use media queries to make your website responsive:

css
Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
/* Default styles for small screens */
body {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

/* Styles for medium screens */
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}

/* Styles for large screens */
@media (min-width: 900px) {
  body {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
}
In this example, the body font size is set to 16px by default, but it increases to 18px on screens that are at least 600px wide and 20px on screens that are at least 900px wide.

You can also use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation to make your website responsive. These frameworks provide pre-built CSS classes that you can use to create responsive layouts.

To create a CV or resume website, you can create a new route in your Express application that renders a template with your CV or resume information. Here's an example of how you can do this:

javascript
Edit
Run
Full Screen
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.get('/resume', (req, res) => {
  res.render('resume', { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`);
});
In this example, the /resume route renders a template called resume with the name and email variables. You can create the resume template using a templating engine like EJS or Pug.

Here's an example of how you can create a resume.ejs template:

html
Edit
Run
Full Screen
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title><%= name %>'s Resume</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1><%= name %></h1>
  <p><%= email %></p>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the name and email variables are inserted into the template using the <%= %> syntax.

I hope this helps
